This week I am in Barcelona with some meetings, trainings and other fun activities with the Elastic crew. Yes, eating amazing ham is one of them :)

Since I wanted to get 110% of my stay here, we also arranged a meetup at [Wallapop](https://www.wallapop.com) offices to meet the local community and talk about what's going in the Elastic ecosystem and present all the amazing goodness we announced in our last Elastic{ON}.

We had around 30 attendees and very interesting discussions. Find below the presentation:
